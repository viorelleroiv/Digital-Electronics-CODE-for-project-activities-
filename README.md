# Digital-Electronics-CODE-for-project-activities-
 contains code, circuit schematics, and documentation related to the DIG. Elec. labs course.  The activities cover both digital logic design and embedded programming, and are implemented using:  🧠 VHDL for the design and simulation of digital systems (FSMs, counters...) ⚙️ C programming for MCS 💻 Practical deployment on the STM32F401RE
